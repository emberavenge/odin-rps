## Stuff I learned:
- That it's important to look at your code and ask the computer what you're asking it to do. 

- That problem solving is very very useful, that is, understanding the problem, planning the  problem, then dividing the problem into sub-problems.

- That I need to use the Javascript web debugger tools more and take more time to debug stuff when stuff isn't working how I want them to.
